1. Work load refers to the length of the list in the box

2. O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n^2), O(2^n), O(n!)

Stacks and Queues

#####Stacks and Queues#####

1.
	1.The process of loading and unloading is a stack because you can add and remove only from top. 

	2. Putting caps on a bottle is a queue becuase you can only add an itme to the back and remove it from front.  And the first bottle that is in queue gets the first cap.
	
	3. Calculating the solution is a queue. 

2. Movie tickets line and accessing web pages are two examplels of a queue

3. Undo button and error tracebacks are two examples of a stack

#####Linked Lists#####

1. The node has two attributes. One is data and another one is next.  "Apple", next" | Berry",next | "Cherry", next are all nodes. 
The data is "Apple", "Berry", Cherry. Head is the first node which is "Apple" and the Tail is the end node which is "Cherry".

2. In a doubly linked list each node has 3 parts.  It has data and pointers to previous and next nodes.  If you add or delete to 
this node you need to update previous and next pointers. And singly linked list has pointers only to the next node. 
And you only need to update the next pointer.

3. Keeing track of the tail in linked list is important.  Otherwise we would have to loop over entire list inorder to find tail.

3. Binary search tree has only a left and right child. The left side of the keys values should be less than or equal
to the root. And the right side of the keys values should greater than or equal to the root.  And child nodes should follow the same 
principal.
Tree is a hierarchical structure. It is a non-lenear structure.  Unlike Binary search tree, tree can have one child or many.
